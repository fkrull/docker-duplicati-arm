# Duplicati Docker images for ARM
These are temporary Docker images for [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/). You should use [the official images](https://hub.docker.com/r/duplicati/duplicati/) if you need images for other architectures or once [issue #3196](https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati/issues/3196) is fixed.
